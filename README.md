# Kitchen-Appliances-Market-Analysis
## project scenario 
- we are a startup starting a business in the kitchen appliances industry, we need to know **our main competitors** , **the most succeful products in each category** , and the **characteristics and pricing of the most succefull products.** - the company is willing to produce products in 7 main categories: air fryers, food processors, espresso machines, blenders, mixers, toasters, and electric kettles. 
in order to answer the above questions I:
- created a web scraping code using beautifulsoup library and scraped the products with 4+ stars rating.
- performed data cleaning using Pandas and SQL to make the data ready for analysis.
- used python pandas, seaborn, and SQL to analyze and visualize the results to find the best products in each category with their description and the best producers also.
# Additional Info
- I uploaded the notebook with only the data analysis section code outputs and commented in some cells that could have deleted the data if I ran them again.
- I stored the data I scraped and cleaned and kept a version of data for every step in the project and saved the versions in the form of csv files and a db.
